### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am Ali Tajabadi.

This is a summary of my abilities and knowledge.

I can manage small teams, because I managed my own teams for about 7 years and I know a lot of details about this topic.

I always try to do things with programming and software in order to have a higher efficiency of them.

The programming languages â€‹â€‹I know are:
1. Python: includes Django (expert and familiar with many libraries), Fast api (beginner), Selenuim, etc.
2. JavaScript: Reactjs, Angularjs (beginner), JQuery
And I can also work with any kind of language to make small changes.

I am also familiar with these softwares:
Photoshop, Primer, 3Ds Max, Office (Word, Excel, Power Point, Visio)

I can work with ubuntu server and recently set up OpenVpn and PPTP on it and created static vpn ip for myself.
I also run all my projects on ubuntu server with nginx and gunicorn and can write ubuntu services to run any python file as ubuntu service.

I am writing a Fastapi-like framework with Python (by Http.server) which you can see on my github as TajDB.

I don't like to imitate in coding, I like to code in my own way. I usually write my programs dynamically. This means that the performance of the program can be changed only by changing some variables. Like my telegram bot on my github.

I like to work with active and organized teams of any size.
